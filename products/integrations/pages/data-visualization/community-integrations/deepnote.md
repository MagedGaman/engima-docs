<a href="https://www.deepnote.com/" target="_blank">Deepnote</a> is a collaborative data notebook built for teams to discover and share insights. In addition to being Jupyter-compatible, it works in the cloud and provides you with one central place to collaborate and work on data science projects efficiently.

This guide assumes you already have a Deepnote account and that you have a running ClickHouse instance.

## Interactive example [#interactive-example]
If you would like to explore an interactive example of querying ClickHouse from Deepnote data notebooks, click the button below to  launch a template project connected to the [ClickHouse playground](../../../getting-started/playground.md).

   **_NOTE:_** If your connection to ClickHouse is protected with an IP Access List, you might need to allow Deepnote's IP addresses. Read more about it in [Deepnote's docs](https://docs.deepnote.com/integrations/authorize-connections-from-deepnote-ip-addresses).

3. Congratulations! You have now integrated ClickHouse into Deepnote.

## Using ClickHouse integration. [#using-clickhouse-integration]

1. Start by connecting to the ClickHouse integration on the right of your notebook.

2. Now create a new ClickHouse query block and query your database. The query results will be saved as a DataFrame and stored in the variable specified in the SQL block.
3. You can also convert any existing [SQL block](https://docs.deepnote.com/features/sql-cells) to a ClickHouse block.
