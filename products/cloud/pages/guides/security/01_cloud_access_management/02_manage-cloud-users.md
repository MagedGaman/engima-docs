This guide is intended for users with the Organization Admin role in ClickHouse Cloud.

## Add users to your organization [#add-users]

### Invite users [#invite-users]

Administrators may invite up to three (3) users at a time and assign organization and service level roles at the time of invitation. 

To invite users:
1. Select the organization name in the lower left corner
2. Click `Users and roles`
3. Select `Invite members` in the upper left corner
4. Enter the email address of up to 3 new users
5. Select the organization and service roles that will be assigned to the users
6. Click `Send invites`

Users will receive an email from which they can join the organization. For more information on accepting invitations, see [Manage my account](/cloud/security/manage-my-account).

### Add users via SAML identity provider [#add-users-via-saml]

<EnterprisePlanFeatureBadge feature="SAML SSO"/>

If your organization is configured for [SAML SSO](/cloud/security/saml-setup) follow these steps to add users to your organization.

1. Add users to your SAML application in your identity provider, the users will not appear in ClickHouse until they have logged in once
2. When the user logs in to ClickHouse Cloud they will automatically be assigned the `Member` role which may only log in and has no other access
3. Follow the instructions in the `Manage user role assignments` below to grant permissions

### Enforcing SAML-only authentication [#enforce-saml]

Once you have at least one SAML user in the organization assigned to the Organization Admin role, remove users with other authentication methods from the organization to enforce SAML only authentication for the organization.

## Manage user role assignments [#manage-role-assignments]

Users assigned the Organization Admin role may update permissions for other users at any time.
