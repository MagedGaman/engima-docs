Delete mutations refers to `ALTER` queries that manipulate table data through delete. Most notably they are queries like `ALTER TABLE DELETE`, etc. Performing such queries will produce new mutated versions of the data parts. This means that such statements would trigger a rewrite of whole data parts for all data that was inserted before the mutation, translating to a large amount of write requests.

<Note>
For deletes, you can avoid these large amounts of write requests by using specialised table engines like [ReplacingMergeTree](/guides/replacing-merge-tree) or [CollapsingMergeTree](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/collapsingmergetree) instead of the default MergeTree table engine.
</Note>


```sql
ALTER TABLE [db.]table [ON CLUSTER cluster] DELETE WHERE filter_expr
```

Deletes data matching the specified filtering expression. Implemented as a [mutation](/sql-reference/statements/alter/index.md#mutations).

<Note>
    The `ALTER TABLE` prefix makes this syntax different from most other systems supporting SQL. It is intended to signify that unlike similar queries in OLTP databases this is a heavy operation not designed for frequent use.  `ALTER TABLE` is considered a heavyweight operation that requires the underlying data to be merged before it is deleted. For MergeTree tables, consider using the [`DELETE FROM` query](/sql-reference/statements/delete.md), which performs a lightweight delete and can be considerably faster.
</Note>

The `filter_expr` must be of type `UInt8`. The query deletes rows in the table for which this expression takes a non-zero value.

One query can contain several commands separated by commas.

The synchronicity of the query processing is defined by the [mutations_sync](/operations/settings/settings.md/#mutations_sync) setting. By default, it is asynchronous.
