## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT and Cline to access external tools and services. By adding the WebRun MCP server, you give these assistants the ability to browse the web autonomously.

## Setup (2 minutes)

### Claude Desktop

**Step 1: Open Configuration File**
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Step 2: Add WebRun Server**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "WebRun": {
      "url": "https://connect.WebRun.click/mcp/sse?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop**
Close and reopen the application. You'll see WebRun tools available in the tool picker.

---

### Cline (VS Code Extension)

**Step 1: Open VS Code Settings**
- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`
- Search for "Cline: Settings"

**Step 2: Add MCP Server**
In the MCP Servers section, add:
```json
{
  "WebRun": {
    "url": "https://connect.WebRun.click/mcp/sse?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Reload Cline**
Reload the extension or restart VS Code.

## Your First Browser Task

Once configured, you can ask Claude to browse the web:

**Example Prompts:**
- "Search Google for Anthropic and summarize the first result"
- "Go to example.com and extract all the product prices"
- "Navigate to LinkedIn, search for software engineers in SF, and list the top 5 results"

**What happens:**
1. Claude recognizes your request requires web browsing
2. It calls the WebRun MCP tool with your task
3. An AI agent executes the task in a real browser
4. Results are returned to Claude
5. Claude presents the information to you

## Available Tools (Summary)

The WebRun MCP server provides several tools:

| Tool | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `browser_task` | Execute a single browser task | Quick one-off automations |
| `create_session` | Start a persistent browser session | Multi-step workflows |
| `send_task_to_session` | Send a task to an existing session | Follow-up actions |
| `get_task_status` | Check the status of a running task | Monitoring long tasks |
| `control_session` | Pause, resume, or stop a session | Manual control |
| `take_over_session` | Enable manual browser control | Human-in-the-loop |

## Example Conversations

### Simple Research

**You:** "Use WebRun to search for 'Claude AI features' on Google and tell me what you find."

**Claude:** *(Uses `browser_task` tool)* "I've searched Google for 'Claude AI features'. Here's what I found: Claude is Anthropic's AI assistant with features including..."

### Multi-Step Workflow

**You:** "Create a browser session, go to Amazon, search for wireless keyboards, and tell me the top 3 results."

**Claude:** *(Uses `create_session`, then `send_task_to_session`)* "I've navigated to Amazon and searched for wireless keyboards. Here are the top 3 results:
1. Logitech K380 - $29.99
2. Keychron K2 - $79.00
3. ...

Would you like me to get more details on any of these?"

## Troubleshooting

### Tools not appearing in Claude Desktop?

1. **Check config file path:** Ensure you edited the correct file location
2. **Verify JSON syntax:** Use a JSON validator to check for syntax errors
3. **Restart Claude:** Fully quit and reopen the application
4. **Check API key:** Ensure your API key is valid and starts with `enig_`

### Authentication errors?

- Verify your API key in the configuration
- Check that you have sufficient balance in your WebRun account
- Ensure the API key has not expired

### Session timeout errors?

- WebRun sessions have a maximum duration of 5 minutes
- For long tasks, break them into smaller sub-tasks
- Use `get_task_status` to monitor progress
