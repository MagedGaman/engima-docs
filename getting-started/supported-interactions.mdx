## Why This Matters

Traditional automation tools like Playwright or Puppeteer require you to write explicit selectors for every element. When websites change their HTML structure, your scripts break.

Enigma's AI agent **understands the visual and semantic context** of web pages. It identifies elements by their purpose, not their code—so your automations keep working even when websites update their design.

**Example:** Instead of writing `document.querySelector('.btn-primary-v2')`, you simply tell Enigma: "Click the submit button."
