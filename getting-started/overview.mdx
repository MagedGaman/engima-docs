WebRun is real-time browser automation infrastructure for AI agents. Give it a task in plain English, and an AI agent executes it in a real browser—clicking, typing, navigating, and extracting data autonomously.

**Key capabilities:**
- Sub-100ms response times via hybrid CNN-LLM architecture
- Live video streaming to observe sessions in real-time
- Human-in-the-loop with guardrails and manual takeover
- Flexible integration via REST API, WebSocket, MCP, or OpenAI-compatible endpoints

## What Can WebRun Do?

### Research & Data Extraction
Gather information from multiple sources, extract structured data, and compile research reports automatically.

**Example:** "Search LinkedIn for engineering managers in San Francisco, extract their profiles, and compile contact information into a structured list."

### Form Automation
Fill out complex forms, handle multi-step workflows, and submit applications with conditional logic.

**Example:** "Go to this insurance quote form, fill it out using the customer data I provide, and return the final quote."

### E-commerce Operations
Search for products, compare prices, add items to cart, and even complete checkout flows with human approval.

**Example:** "Find the top 3 wireless keyboards on Amazon under $50, add the best-rated one to cart, and show me the checkout page."

### Dynamic Testing
Test web applications with natural language instructions, adapting to UI changes without brittle selectors.

**Example:** "Navigate through the signup flow, try to register with invalid data, and report any validation errors you encounter."

## How It Works

### Sessions & Tasks

A **session** is an isolated browser instance controlled by an AI agent. A **task** is a single objective for the agent to complete within that session.

```
Session (sessionId: "sess_abc")
 ├── Task 1 → completed
 ├── Task 2 → completed
 └── Task 3 → guardrail triggered
```

Sessions persist until you terminate them or they time out (max 5 minutes). One session can run multiple tasks sequentially.

### Response Model

Most browser tasks complete in 10-40 seconds. WebRun waits up to 50 seconds for your task to finish—meaning you typically get results inline, in a single request.

```
POST /start/run-task
     ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Task completes in < 50s?          │
│  ├── Yes → Result returned inline  │
│  └── No  → pollUrl returned        │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This gives you the simplicity of synchronous APIs for typical tasks, with the reliability of async for complex multi-step operations.

### Guardrails

When the agent needs human input—credentials, clarification, approval—it triggers a guardrail and pauses. Your application detects this and provides the input.

**Common triggers:** Login forms, purchase confirmations, CAPTCHAs, ambiguous instructions.

## Choose Your Integration

### Which endpoint should I use?

```
Need browser automation?
├── Single task, don't care about session? → POST /start/run-task
├── Multiple tasks in sequence? → POST /start/start-session + /send-message
├── Using LangChain/existing OpenAI code? → POST /v1/chat/completions
└── Using Claude Desktop/MCP client? → MCP Server
```

### REST vs WebSocket?

- **REST:** Simpler. Good enough for 90% of use cases. Poll for results.
- **WebSocket:** Only if you need live agent thoughts or sub-second event handling.

## Integration Methods

| Method | Best For | Real-time Events |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **REST API** | Simple integrations, serverless, stateless workflows | Poll for updates |
| **WebSocket** | Live dashboards, interactive UIs, real-time agent thoughts | Yes |
| **OpenAI-Compatible** | LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vercel AI SDK, existing OpenAI tooling | Poll or stream |
| **MCP Server** | Claude Desktop, Cline, any MCP-compatible AI assistant | No |
| **Workflows** | n8n, Make.com, Zapier | Poll for updates |

## WebRun vs. Traditional Automation

| | WebRun | Playwright/Puppeteer |
|--|--------|----------------------|
| **Input** | Natural language | Code |
| **Adaptability** | AI agent adapts to UI changes | Scripts break on changes |
| **Maintenance** | Self-healing | Manual updates required |
| **Latency** | Sub-100ms decisions | ~50ms per action |
| **Best for** | Dynamic tasks, scraping, form-filling | Regression testing, CI/CD |
