<br />

5. Note that at this point, the setup is not complete yet. You will need to redirect to ClickHouse Cloud by clicking on **Set up your account** and signing up on ClickHouse Cloud.

6. Once you redirect to ClickHouse Cloud, you can either login with an existing account, or register with a new account. This step is very important so we can bind your ClickHouse Cloud organization to the GCP Marketplace billing.

<br />

If you are a new ClickHouse Cloud user, click **Register** at the bottom of the page. You will be prompted to create a new user and verify the email. After verifying your email, you can leave the ClickHouse Cloud login page and login using the new username at the [https://console.clickhouse.cloud](https://console.clickhouse.cloud).

<br />

If you are an existing ClickHouse Cloud user, simply log in using your credentials.

7. After successfully logging in, a new ClickHouse Cloud organization will be created. This organization will be connected to your GCP billing account and all usage will be billed via your GCP account.

8. Once you login, you can confirm that your billing is in fact tied to the GCP Marketplace and start setting up your ClickHouse Cloud resources.
