To connect a database with DbVisualizer, you must first create and setup a Database Connection.

1. Create a new connection from **Database->Create Database Connection** and select a driver for your database from the popup menu.

2. An **Object View** tab for the new connection is opened.

3. Enter a name for the connection in the **Name** field, and optionally enter a description of the connection in the **Notes** field.

4. Leave the **Database Type** as **Auto Detect**.
