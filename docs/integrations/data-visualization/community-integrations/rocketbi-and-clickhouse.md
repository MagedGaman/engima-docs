<br/>

Add duplicate variants with different lookup ranges. For example, Year, Monthly, Daily date or Day of Week.

Choose Adding new chart, then Select Pie Chart

Drag & Drop the Metrics Control into Value Field

<img src="/images/integrations/data-visualization/rocketbi_11.png" alt="Metrics control being added to the value field of the pie chart" />

(you can also use Metrics Control as Sorting)

Navigate to Chart Setting for further customization

<img src="/images/integrations/data-visualization/rocketbi_12.png" alt="Chart settings panel showing customization options for the pie chart" />

<br/>

Save & Add the Chart to Dashboard

<img src="/images/integrations/data-visualization/rocketbi_14.png" alt="Dashboard view showing the newly added pie chart with other controls" />

Let Use a Stacked Column Chart

<img src="/images/integrations/data-visualization/rocketbi_15.png" alt="Stacked column chart creation interface with time-series data" />
<br/>

In Chart Control, use Metrics Control as Y-axis & Date Range as X-axis

<img src="/images/integrations/data-visualization/rocketbi_16.png" alt="Chart control configuration showing metrics on Y-axis and date range on X-axis" />
<br/>

Add Region column in to Breakdown

<img src="/images/integrations/data-visualization/rocketbi_17.png" alt="Region column being added as breakdown dimension in the stacked column chart" />
