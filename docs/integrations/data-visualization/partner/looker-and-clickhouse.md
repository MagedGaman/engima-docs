Looker can connect to ClickHouse Cloud or on-premise deployment via the official ClickHouse data source.

## 1. Gather your connection details [#1-gather-your-connection-details]

<GatherYourDetailsHttp />

## 2. Create a ClickHouse data source [#2-create-a-clickhouse-data-source]

Navigate to Admin -> Database -> Connections and click the "Add Connection" button in the top right corner.

Choose a name for your data source, and select `ClickHouse` from the dialect drop-down. Enter your credentials in the form.

If you are using ClickHouse Cloud or your deployment requires SSL, make sure you have SSL turned on in the additional settings.

Test your connection first, and, once it is done, connect to your new ClickHouse data source.

Now you should be able to attach ClickHouse Datasource to your Looker project.
