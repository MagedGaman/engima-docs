## What is a Task?

A **task** is a single objective for the AI agent to complete within a browser session. Each task is described in natural language and executed autonomously by the agent.

Examples of tasks:
- "Search Google for Anthropic and return the first result"
- "Find the price of the wireless keyboard on this page"
- "Fill out this form with the provided data and submit it"
- "Navigate through the checkout flow and screenshot the payment page"

---

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks progress through several states from initiation to completion:

```
┌─────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Started │────►│  Running  │────►│ task_completed  │
└─────────┘     └───────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                     │
                     ├───────────► guardrail_trigger
                     │
                     └───────────► failed
```

| State | Description | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `started` | Task has been accepted and queued | Agent prepares to execute |
| `running` | Agent is actively executing the task | Browser actions occurring |
| `task_completed` | Task finished successfully | Result available in response |
| `guardrail_trigger` | Agent needs human input to proceed | Task paused, awaiting response |
| `failed` | Task encountered an error | Session may continue or terminate |

---

## Task Patterns

### Single Task (`run-task`)

For one-off tasks where you don't need to maintain browser state. The session auto-terminates after completion.

```bash
POST /start/run-task
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "taskDetails": "Go to news.ycombinator.com and return the titles of the top 3 posts",
  "maxDuration": 60000
}
```

### Multi-Task Session

For workflows requiring sequential tasks within the same browser context. The session persists across tasks, preserving cookies, authentication, and page state.

```bash
# 1. Create session with initial task
POST /start/start-session

{
  "initialTask": {
    "taskDetails": "Log into the dashboard",
    "startingPoint": "https://example.com/login"
  }
}

# 2. Send follow-up tasks to the session
POST /start/send-message

{
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "message": {
    "actionType": "newTask",
    "newState": "start",
    "taskDetails": "Navigate to billing settings",
    "terminateOnCompletion": true
  }
}
```

| Aspect | Single Task | Multi-Task Session |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Session lifecycle** | Auto-closes after task | Persists until terminated |
| **Use case** | Isolated, simple tasks | Multi-step workflows |
| **State sharing** | None | Cookies, auth, page context preserved |

## Task Properties

### Task Identification
Each task gets a unique `taskId` when created. Use this ID to:
- Poll for task status (REST API)
- Track specific tasks in multi-task workflows
- Retrieve task results

### Task Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `taskDetails` | string | required | Natural language task description |
| `maxDuration` | number | 300000 | Max time for this task in ms |
| `maxInputTokens` | number | 100000 | Max input tokens |
| `maxOutputTokens` | number | 100000 | Max output tokens |
| `startingUrl` | string | null | Starting URL (optional) |
| `avoidDomains` | string[] | `[]` | Domains to avoid |
| `terminateOnCompletion` | boolean | false | Auto-terminate session after this task |

---

## Task Execution

### Sequential Execution
Within a single session, tasks run sequentially:

```
Session: sess_abc
├── Task 1 (running) → completes
├── Task 2 (queued) → starts → completes
└── Task 3 (queued) → starts → completes
```

You cannot run multiple tasks in parallel within the same session. For concurrent execution, use multiple sessions.

### Task Duration
Most tasks complete in 10-40 seconds. The API waits up to 50 seconds before returning a `pollUrl` for longer tasks.

**Typical completion times:**
- Simple search/navigation: 10-20 seconds
- Form filling: 20-40 seconds
- Complex multi-step: 60-120 seconds

## Task Results

When a task completes, you receive a structured result:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "sessionId": "sess_7f8a9b2c",
  "taskId": "task_3e4f5a6b",
  "result": {
    "type": "task_completed",
    "data": {
      "message": "Here are the top 3 posts:\n1. Show HN: I built a new programming language\n2. The future of web browsers\n3. Why SQLite is so popular",
      "completion_time": 23.5,
      "prompt_tokens": 12450,
      "completion_tokens": 3200,
      "total_tokens": 15650
    }
  },
  "usage": {
    "inputTokens": 12450,
    "outputTokens": 3200,
    "computeTime": 5,
    "cost": 0.0124
  },
  "completedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `message` | Natural language result from the agent |
| `completion_time` | Time taken to complete task (seconds) |
| `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` | Token usage |
| `cost` | Total cost in USD |
| `completedAt` | ISO 8601 timestamp |

## Writing Effective Task Descriptions

### Be Specific
❌ "Find products"
✅ "Search Amazon for wireless keyboards under $50 and return the top 3 results with prices"

### Include Context
❌ "Click the button"
✅ "Click the blue 'Add to Cart' button next to the first product"

### Specify Output Format
❌ "Get the data"
✅ "Extract the product name, price, and rating as a JSON object"

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Template |
|---------|----------|
| Research & Extraction | "Search for [topic] and return [specific data]" |
| Navigation & Screenshot | "Go to [URL] and take a screenshot of [element]" |
| Form Filling | "Fill out the form with: Name=[value], Email=[value], then submit" |
| Verification | "Check if [condition] is true on [page]" |
| Conditional Actions | "If [condition], then [action], otherwise [alternative]" |

### Break Down Complex Tasks
❌ "Research this company and create a report"
✅ Send as separate tasks:
1. "Search Google for [company name] and find their website"
2. "Navigate to their About page and extract the company description"
3. "Find their contact information and return it in structured format"

## Task Constraints

### Maximum Duration
Tasks inherit the session's `maxDuration` (default 5 minutes) but can have a shorter limit specified per-task.

### Token Limits
Tasks are constrained by `maxInputTokens` and `maxOutputTokens`. If limits are exceeded:
- Input limit: Task fails with error
- Output limit: Agent's response is truncated

### Domain Restrictions
If `avoidDomains` is set, the agent will:
- Refuse to navigate to those domains
- Trigger a guardrail if instructed to visit them
- Skip links to those domains in search results
