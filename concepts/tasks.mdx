## What is a Task?

A **task** is a single objective for the AI agent to complete within a browser session. Each task is described in natural language and executed autonomously by the agent.

Examples of tasks:
- "Search Google for Anthropic and return the first result"
- "Find the price of the wireless keyboard on this page"
- "Fill out this form with the provided data and submit it"
- "Navigate through the checkout flow and screenshot the payment page"

---

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks progress through several states from initiation to completion:

```
┌─────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Started │────►│  Running  │────►│ task_completed  │
└─────────┘     └───────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                     │
                     ├───────────► guardrail_trigger
                     │
                     └───────────► failed
```

### Task States

| State | Description | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `started` | Task has been accepted and queued | Agent prepares to execute |
| `running` | Agent is actively executing the task | Browser actions occurring |
| `task_completed` | Task finished successfully | Result available in response |
| `guardrail_trigger` | Agent needs human input to proceed | Task paused, awaiting response |
| `failed` | Task encountered an error | Session may continue or terminate |

---

## Task Properties

### Task Identification
Each task gets a unique `taskId` when created. Use this ID to:
- Poll for task status (REST API)
- Track specific tasks in multi-task workflows
- Retrieve task results

### Task Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `taskDetails` | string | required | Natural language task description |
| `maxDuration` | number | 300000 | Max time for this task in ms |
| `maxInputTokens` | number | 100000 | Max input tokens |
| `maxOutputTokens` | number | 100000 | Max output tokens |
| `startingUrl` | string | null | Starting URL (optional) |
| `avoidDomains` | string[] | `[]` | Domains to avoid |
| `terminateOnCompletion` | boolean | false | Auto-terminate session after this task |

## Task Results

When a task completes successfully, you receive a structured result:

```json
{
  "type": "task_completed",
  "data": {
    "message": "Successfully completed the search",
    "completion_time": 23.5,
    "prompt_tokens": 12450,
    "completion_tokens": 3200,
    "total_tokens": 15650
  },
  "usage": {
    "inputTokens": 12450,
    "outputTokens": 3200,
    "computeTime": 5,
    "cost": 0.0124
  },
  "completedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Result Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `message` | Natural language result from the agent |
| `completion_time` | Time taken to complete task (seconds) |
| `prompt_tokens` | Input tokens used |
| `completion_tokens` | Output tokens generated |
| `total_tokens` | Sum of input and output tokens |
| `cost` | Total cost in USD |
| `completedAt` | ISO 8601 timestamp |

## Task Execution

### Sequential Execution
Within a single session, tasks run sequentially:

```
Session: sess_abc
├── Task 1 (running) → completes
├── Task 2 (queued) → starts → completes
└── Task 3 (queued) → starts → completes
```

You cannot run multiple tasks in parallel within the same session. For concurrent execution, use multiple sessions.

### Task Duration
Most tasks complete in 10-40 seconds. The API waits up to 50 seconds before returning a `pollUrl` for longer tasks.

**Typical completion times:**
- Simple search/navigation: 10-20 seconds
- Form filling: 20-40 seconds
- Complex multi-step: 60-120 seconds

### Task Dependencies
Tasks can build on previous state within a session:

```javascript
// Task 1: Login
await sendTask("Log into the website with these credentials");

// Task 2: Navigate (depends on being logged in)
await sendTask("Go to my account settings");

// Task 3: Extract (depends on being in settings)
await sendTask("Extract my email address");
```

## Writing Effective Task Descriptions

### Be Specific
❌ "Find products"
✅ "Search Amazon for wireless keyboards under $50 and return the top 3 results with prices"

### Include Context
❌ "Click the button"
✅ "Click the blue 'Add to Cart' button next to the first product"

### Specify Output Format
❌ "Get the data"
✅ "Extract the product name, price, and rating as a JSON object"

### Break Down Complex Tasks
❌ "Research this company and create a report"
✅
1. "Search Google for [company name] and find their website"
2. "Navigate to their About page and extract the company description"
3. "Find their contact information and return it in structured format"

---

## Task Constraints

### Maximum Duration
Tasks inherit the session's `maxDuration` (default 5 minutes) but can have a shorter limit specified per-task.

### Token Limits
Tasks are constrained by `maxInputTokens` and `maxOutputTokens`. If limits are exceeded:
- Input limit: Task fails with error
- Output limit: Agent's response is truncated

### Domain Restrictions
If `avoidDomains` is set, the agent will:
- Refuse to navigate to those domains
- Trigger a guardrail if instructed to visit them
- Skip links to those domains in search results

---

## Common Task Patterns

### Research & Extraction
"Search for [topic] and return [specific data]"

### Navigation & Screenshot
"Go to [URL] and take a screenshot of [element]"

### Form Filling
"Fill out the form with: Name=[value], Email=[value], then submit"

### Verification
"Check if [condition] is true on [page]"

### Conditional Actions
"If [condition], then [action], otherwise [alternative action]"
