## Pricing Model

WebRun charges for two components:

1. **Token Usage** — AI model input/output tokens
2. **Compute Time** — Browser instance runtime

Both are tracked per-task and returned in the `usage` object of each response.

---

## Token Pricing

WebRun uses proprietary browser-optimized AI models:

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Best For |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|----------|
| **enigma-browser-pro** | $0.60 | $2.70 | Complex tasks, high accuracy |
| **enigma-browser-fast** | $$0.60 | $1.80 | Simple tasks, faster execution |


### What Counts as Tokens?

**Input Tokens:**
- Your task description
- Page content (HTML, text visible to agent)
- Agent's internal reasoning
- Previous task context in multi-task sessions

**Output Tokens:**
- Agent's thoughts and actions
- Result message returned to you
- Navigation decisions
- Error messages

---

## Compute Pricing

Compute time is charged per second of active session time:

| Resource | Rate |
|----------|------|
| **Browser Instance** | $0.XX per minute |

**What counts as compute time:**
- Time from session creation to termination
- Includes idle time between tasks
- Maximum 5 minutes per session

<Warning>
**Avoid Idle Charges:** Sessions remain billable until terminated. Always use `terminateOnCompletion: true` on your final task or manually terminate sessions when done.
</Warning>

---

## Cost Examples

Typical costs for common tasks:

| Task Type | Tokens Used | Duration | Est. Cost |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Simple search** | ~10,000 | 20s | $0.01 |
| **Form filling** | ~25,000 | 45s | $0.03 |
| **Data extraction** | ~40,000 | 60s | $0.05 |
| **Multi-step workflow** | ~100,000 | 3min | $0.15 |
| **Complex automation** | ~200,000 | 5min | $0.30 |

<Note>
These are estimates. Actual costs depend on page complexity, task specificity, and agent efficiency.

## Cost Breakdown in Responses

Every task response includes detailed cost information:

```json
{
  "type": "task_completed",
  "data": {
    "message": "Task completed successfully",
    "prompt_tokens": 12450,
    "completion_tokens": 3200,
    "total_tokens": 15650,
    "completion_time": 23.5
  },
  "usage": {
    "inputTokens": 12450,
    "outputTokens": 3200,
    "computeTime": 5,
    "cost": 0.0124
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `prompt_tokens` | Input tokens used |
| `completion_tokens` | Output tokens generated |
| `total_tokens` | Sum of input + output |
| `completion_time` | Task duration in seconds |
| `computeTime` | Billable compute time in seconds |
| `cost` | Total cost in USD |

---

## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Use `terminateOnCompletion: true`

**Problem:** Sessions continue running (and billing) after tasks complete.
**Solution:** Auto-terminate when done.

```json
{
  "taskDetails": "Search for products",
  "terminateOnCompletion": true
}
```

**Savings:** Eliminates idle session costs.

---

### 2. Set Appropriate `maxDuration`

**Problem:** Default 5-minute sessions may run longer than needed.
**Solution:** Set realistic timeouts.

```json
{
  "taskDetails": "Quick search task",
  "maxDuration": 60000  // 1 minute
}
```

**Savings:** Prevents runaway sessions.

---

### 3. Use `enigma-browser-fast` for Simple Tasks

**Problem:** Using the standard model for simple tasks wastes money.
**Solution:** Specify the fast model when appropriate.

```json
{
  "model": "enigma-browser-fast",
  "taskDetails": "Get the title of this page"
}
```

**Savings:** 33% reduction in token costs.

---

### 4. Optimize Task Descriptions

**Problem:** Verbose or vague instructions waste tokens.
**Solution:** Be concise and specific.

❌ **Verbose:**
"Please navigate to the website and then search for the product I mentioned earlier and then click on the first result and extract all the information you can find about it."

✅ **Optimized:**
"Search for [product] and return: name, price, rating from first result."

**Savings:** Reduces input tokens by 50-70%.

---

### 5. Batch Related Tasks in Single Sessions

**Problem:** Creating separate sessions for related tasks multiplies compute costs.
**Solution:** Chain tasks in one session.

❌ **Expensive:**
```javascript
await runTask("Go to amazon.com");  // New session
await runTask("Search for keyboards");  // Another new session
await runTask("Get first result price");  // Yet another session
```

✅ **Optimized:**
```javascript
const session = await startSession("Go to amazon.com");
await sendTask(session, "Search for keyboards");
await sendTask(session, "Get first result price");
await terminateSession(session);
```

**Savings:** 3x reduction in compute costs.

---

### 6. Avoid Unnecessary Page Loads

**Problem:** Navigating to unnecessary pages burns tokens.
**Solution:** Be specific about starting URLs.

❌ **Wasteful:**
```json
{
  "taskDetails": "Search Amazon for keyboards"
}
```

✅ **Optimized:**
```json
{
  "taskDetails": "Search for keyboards",
  "startingUrl": "https://amazon.com"
}
```

**Savings:** Skips homepage → search navigation.

---

### 7. Use `avoidDomains` to Prevent Detours

**Problem:** Agent accidentally navigates to unrelated domains.
**Solution:** Block known distractions.

```json
{
  "taskDetails": "Research this topic",
  "avoidDomains": ["facebook.com", "twitter.com", "instagram.com"]
}
```

**Savings:** Prevents wasted navigation.

## Monitoring Costs

### Dashboard
View historical usage and costs at [app.webrun.ai](https://app.webrun.ai/usage).

### API Responses
Every task response includes the `usage.cost` field for real-time tracking.

### Polling Updates
When polling long-running tasks, cost accumulates in real-time:

```json
{
  "pending": true,
  "usage": {
    "cost": 0.0045  // Current cost, will increase as task continues
  }
}
```
