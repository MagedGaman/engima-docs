WebRun charges for **token usage** and **compute time**.

## What Tasks Cost

Real examples from production usage:

| Task Type | Typical Cost | Duration |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Simple search (Google, LinkedIn) | $0.01 | ~20s |
| Form filling (3-5 fields) | $0.02 | ~25s |
| Data extraction (10-20 items) | $0.05 | ~50s |
| Multi-step workflow (5+ tasks) | $0.08 | ~2min |
| Complex automation (10+ tasks) | $0.30 | ~5min |

Actual costs vary based on page complexity and task specificity.

## Pricing

### Tokens

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **enigma-browser-pro** | $0.60 | $2.70 |
| **enigma-browser-fast** | $0.60 | $1.80 |

### Compute

**$0.02 per minute** of active session time.

Compute time runs from session creation until termination or timeout (5 minute maximum). WebRun provisions real desktop environments with dedicated resources for each session, ensuring consistent browser behavior across all tasks.

<Warning>
Sessions remain billable until terminated. Set `terminateOnCompletion: true` on your final task or explicitly call terminate to avoid charges for the full timeout window.
</Warning>

## Usage Tracking

Every response includes a `usage` object with real-time cost tracking:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sessionId": "abc123",
  "taskId": "xyz789",
  "type": "task_completed",
  "data": {
    "message": "Task completed successfully"
  },
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 12450,
    "completion_tokens": 3200,
    "total_tokens": 15650,
    "completion_time": 23.5,
    "cost": 0.0124
  }
}
```
