## Sessions & Performance

### How long can sessions run?

Sessions can run indefinitely while active and expire after 5 minutes of inactivity. Configure the inactivity timeout with `maxDuration` (in milliseconds). Default is 300000 (5 minutes of inactivity) if not specified.

Sessions timeout at `maxDuration` or when explicitly terminated. Always terminate sessions when finished.

[Session lifecycle documentation](/concepts/sessions#lifecycle)

---

### Can I run parallel sessions?

Yes. Concurrent session limits:
- **Free Tier:** 2 sessions
- **Pro Tier:** 15 sessions
- **Enterprise:** Custom limits

When you hit the limit, new session requests fail with `SESSION_LIMIT_REACHED`. Terminate unused sessions before creating new ones or upgrade your plan.

[Session management](/concepts/sessions)

---

### What browsers does WebRun use?

Chrome only. Latest stable version. Standard desktop user agent (Windows 10, 64-bit).

We don't support Firefox, Safari, custom versions, or mobile emulation yet.

---

### What's the browser resolution?

1920×1080 (Full HD). Fixed resolution for all sessions.

Custom viewport sizes and mobile device emulation aren't supported yet.

---

## Authentication & Security

### How do I handle website login?

Three approaches:

**1. Provide credentials in task description:**
```json
{
  "taskDetails": "Navigate to example.com/login, enter username 'user@example.com' and password 'pass123', then go to dashboard"
}
```

**2. Handle via guardrails:**
When the agent encounters a login form, it triggers a guardrail. Your app provides credentials through the guardrail response.

**3. Manual takeover:**
Use manual control to enter credentials yourself while watching the video stream.

[Guardrails guide](/usage-guides/handling-guardrails) | [Manual control](/usage-guides/manual-interaction)

---

### Is my data secure?

**Session isolation:** Each session runs in an isolated browser instance. No shared cookies, localStorage, or cache between sessions. Instances are destroyed after termination.

**Encryption:** All API communication uses HTTPS/TLS 1.3. WebSocket connections are encrypted (WSS).

**Data retention:** Session logs are deleted after 30 days. Screenshots and recordings are deleted with the session.

**Credentials:** WebRun doesn't store credentials you provide to websites. Don't hardcode credentials—use environment variables.

---

### How do I handle CAPTCHAs?

CAPTCHAs require manual intervention. When the agent encounters a CAPTCHA, it triggers a guardrail. Use manual takeover to solve it while watching the video stream, then release control.

No automated CAPTCHA solving. Use rate limiting to reduce CAPTCHA frequency.

[Manual control guide](/usage-guides/manual-interaction)

## Integration & Compatibility

### Does WebRun work with my framework?

WebRun provides REST and WebSocket APIs. Any language or framework that makes HTTP requests works.

**Supported:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, Deno, Bun)
- Python (requests, httpx, FastAPI)
- Any language with HTTP/WebSocket support

**Popular integrations:**
- Next.js / React
- Express.js
- FastAPI / Django
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vercel AI SDK (via OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

[Integration guides](/integrations/rest-api)

---

### Can I use WebRun with MCP?

Yes. WebRun provides a native Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

Install: `npx -y @webrun/mcp-server`

[MCP integration guide](/integrations/mcp-server)

---

### Can I use my own LLM API keys?

No. WebRun uses its own browser-optimized AI models. You cannot bring your own API keys or use different models.

Costs are included in your WebRun usage and billed based on input/output tokens.

[Pricing](/concepts/pricing)

---

## Pricing & Billing

### Is there a free tier?

Yes. $5 free credits per month, 2 concurrent sessions, unlimited session duration (expires after 5 minutes of inactivity). All API features enabled.

Credits reset monthly and don't roll over.

[Pricing plans](/concepts/pricing)

---

### How are tokens counted?

**Input tokens:** Task description, page HTML/DOM content, previous conversation history, agent reasoning.

**Output tokens:** Agent actions, navigation decisions, extracted data, status messages.

Token costs:
- Input: $0.60 per 1M tokens
- Output: $1.80-2.70 per 1M tokens (model dependent)

Input tokens are cheaper because the model processes them in parallel. Output generation is sequential.

[Token usage guide](/concepts/pricing#token-pricing)

---

### Do idle sessions cost money?

No token costs during idle time. However, idle sessions occupy a concurrent session slot and consume compute time from creation until termination.

Always terminate sessions when finished to free up session slots.

[Cost optimization](/usage-guides/cost-optimization)

---

### Can I set spending limits?

Yes. Configure spending limits in your account at [app.webrun.ai/billing](https://app.webrun.ai/billing).

Options: Hard limits (API requests fail when reached) or soft limits (alerts only).

---

## Technical Details

### What User-Agent does WebRun use?

Standard Chrome User-Agent matching the latest stable version:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
```

Appears as Windows 10, 64-bit Chrome. Not marked as headless or automated.

Cannot currently customize user agent, platform, or browser version.

---

### Can I use proxies?

**Standard Plans:** No proxy support.

**Enterprise Plans:** Yes. Residential proxy pools, geographic targeting, rotating IPs, and custom proxy servers available.

Contact sales@webrun.ai for Enterprise pricing.

---

### Can I access browser console logs?

Not directly. Critical JavaScript errors are captured and may be included in task results.

For debugging, use guardrails to ask the agent: "Tell me if there are any JavaScript errors visible on the page."

[Debugging guide](/troubleshooting/common-issues)

---

### Can WebRun access sites behind login?

Yes, with considerations:

**Works:** Username/password forms, cookie-based auth
**Limited:** 2FA/MFA (requires manual intervention), OAuth flows (complex), session persistence (cookies don't persist across different sessions)

Provide credentials directly in task description or handle via guardrails.
